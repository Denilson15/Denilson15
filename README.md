# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Denilson Alvarado  

I began my computer science journey in **Summer 2024** after pivoting from a background in Business. This transition has been driven by a deep commitment to problem-solving and a passion for engineering. Just months after my first C++ course, I stepped into teaching **AP Computer Science Principles**, helping my students earn college credit while I solidified my own technical foundation.

I am currently a **Conditionally Classified Graduate Student** pursuing a **Master’s in Computer Science** with a focus on **AI/ML**.
