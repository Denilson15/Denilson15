# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Denilson Alvarado  

I began my computer science journey in **Summer 2024**, completing my first course in C++. Just a month later, I stepped into teaching **AP Computer Science Principles** at the high school level. By the end of the year, **My students earned college credit in computer science**, even as I continued building my own foundation in the field.  

Since then, I’ve rapidly expanded my knowledge in **C++**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **functional programming with OCaml**, while completing core CS and math coursework including:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- OOP
- Databases/SQL
- Programming Language Concepts
- Automata & Computation
- Discrete Math

## 💻 What I'm Working On  

- Building frontend projects with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and exploring APIs  
- Strengthening my C++ and JavaScript skills through assignments, demos, and personal projects  
- Experimenting with **AI-based projects** by integrating APIs (e.g., language models, data-driven applications)  
- Learning backend fundamentals and preparing for advanced CS coursework  
- Documenting all projects with detailed READMEs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Languages**: C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, OCaml, SQL  
- **Tools**: GitHub, VS Code, Netlify, Vite, Visual Studio  
- **Learning**: React, Firebase, Linux (UNIX), Assembly

## 🌱 My CS Journey  

I originally earned my **bachelor’s degree in Business**, but in **Summer 2024** I began formally studying computer science. In just over a year, I’ve gone from completing my first intro course to teaching AP CS Principles and finishing a wide range of CS fundamentals.  

This fall (2025), I’m enrolled in:  
- Operating Systems  
- Intro to UNIX  
- Intro to Assembly  
- Statistics for Engineers  

I’m on track to finish my **associate’s in CS** while completing master’s prerequisites, and I’ve already been admitted to a **Master’s in Computer Science (AI/ML)** program.  

Along the way, I’ve pushed myself to learn **React** and build projects with **API integrations**, available here on my GitHub.  

Even though I’m new to the field, I’ve shown the ability to **learn quickly, understand fundamentals deeply, and apply them effectively**.
